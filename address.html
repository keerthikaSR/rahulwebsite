   <p>
      I am Rahul Pavithran, a dedicated and motivated professional from Kannur, Kerala, with an academic background in
      Mechatronics Engineering. I began my career as a Service Engineer in Coimbatore, where I gained valuable hands-on
      experience in technical service and field operations.
      Driven by a strong passion for technology and problem-solving, I developed a keen interest in software
      development. Despite having no initial background in this field, I committed myself to continuous learning and
      upskilling. Through consistent effort and self-discipline, I have successfully transitioned into a career in
      software development.
      Today, I am confident in my technical abilities and excited to contribute meaningfully to the software industry.
      I‚Äôm passionate about building innovative solutions and eager to grow further as a developer.</p>

   <p>I started my career as a Service Engineer, but along the way, I discovered a true passion for software development. Without any prior coding experience, I challenged myself to learn from scratch. Over time, through consistent practice and curiosity, I built strong development skills ‚Äî and turned my passion into a profession.</p>
